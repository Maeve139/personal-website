    	<section><h2>Hello!</h2>
      <p>My name is Maeve Greising, and I am currently a student at Oberlin College of Arts and Sciences. I am a senior majoring in Creative Writing and pursuing additional studies in Theatre, English, and Computer Science.</p></section>
    	
    	<section>
        <h3 class="highlight">At the beginning of my Oberlin career, I was planning on majoring in Computer Science and Creative Writing.</h3>
        <p>Though I had done well in my computer science class in high school, I learned that it was not the right major for me. As I found myself drawn closer to the humanities and performing arts, the time and energy I had available for computer science faded away until it was not sufficient to sustain my involvement in CS major coursework.</p>
   		  <p>Fortunately, despite these setbacks, I have managed to sustain independent studies in computer science, including maintaining my Java and Scheme knowledge and pursuing online courses in web design. To learn more about my computer science work, take a look at <a href="cs.html"> the computer science portion of my website</a>.</p>
      </section>

   		<section>
        <h3 class="highlight">Partially to blame for my departure from the world of computer science is my growing interest and participation in theatre activities and productions on campus.</h3>
        <p>Throughout my time at Oberlin, the importance of theatre in my life has slowly grown such that it is now my primary extracurricular pursuit. To learn more about how theatre has grown in my life and which theatrical projects I am currently pursuing, check out <a href="theater.html"> the theater portion of my website</a>.</p>
      </section>

   		<section>
        <h3 class="highlight">In the course of my work in theatre and my English and Creative Writing studies, I have found a multitude of opportunities to expland my design skills.</h3>
        <p>I have used every available opportunity to use and improve my design skills, including drawing, graphic design, layout, and web design. I have served as a graphic designer for several student productions and incorporated layout and graphic design into creative final projects for many of my classes in late high school and college</p>
   		  <p>For more on my work and explorations in design, check out <a href="design.html">the design portion of my website</a>.</p>
      </section>

   		<section>
        <h3 class="highlight">Last but not least, let me talk about my writing.</h3>
        <p>I have been talking since I was 3 years old, and I have stopped at almost nothing to keep producing words since then.</p>
   		  <p>I wrote short stories casually throughout elementary, middle, and high school, so when I was looking for colleges, it was only natural that I listed Creative Writing as one of my major interests. I was fortunate enough, through a combination of carefully planned coursework and some changes in the structure of the Creative Writing department, to declare my major in Creative Writing at the midpoint of my Junior year.</p>
   		  <p>As such, the primary focus of my coursework and much of my independent studies is writing and finding new ways to use my writing and editing skills. To find out more, check out <a href="writing.html">the writing section of my website</a>.</p>
      </section>

   		<section class="highlight"><h3>That's all the areas covered on this site, but certainly not all I do!</h3>
