        <p>I have been writing for as long as I can remember. In elementary school, long before I had solidly identified any of my other long-term interests, I was writing little stories and encouraging my friends to illustrate them. While these stories were simple and drew from my limited experience at the time, they were the beginning of something much bigger.</p>
        <p>As I grew up, although many things changed in my life, a passion for writing stayed with me. In middle and high school, I took every chance I could to write, sometimes even weaving through a crowded hallway, notebook in hand, writing as I walked. During this time, I thought frequently of my future. I saw myself as a lawyer or an analyst, maybe a programmer of some sort. I imagined a future that might involve working in a cubicle and would most certainly <em> not </em> involve engaging my creative side. From time to time, I imagined that I might be a writer, but it was always the same sort of pipe dream as being an actor or a celebrity.</p>
        <p class="highlight">Doing writing seriously didn't feel like it could be real until it was.</p>
        <p>Once I was in college, it seemed like the logical choice to major in Creative Writing. There was nothing else to which I had devoted so much time with so much success. Although it took my a while to get into the program, I was able to successfully complete the Creative Writing major coursework and capstone in four years. While I consider that to be an accomplishment, I certainly hope that it is not my last in writing. I have several projects in progress now, some of which I hope to get published eventually.</p>
        <p>To hear more about the courses I took at Oberlin, go to <a href=writing-coursework.html>my writing coursework page</a>. To see some of the pieces I have finished, go to <a href=writing-projects.html>Projects & Explorations</a>. To hear about what I'm working on right now, go to <a href=writing-present.html>Present Pursuits</a>.</p>
