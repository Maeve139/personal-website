      <h2>Your show <span style="text-decoration:underline">must</span> go on!</h2>
      <p>During high school, I watched from a distance as many of my friends and close collaborators spent hours upon hours preparing for plays and musicals and even the occasional opera. I thought, "I can't possibly do that - I'm already far too busy." I was not entirely wrong.</p>
      <p>by college, I had no involvement in theater, but my interest was still increasing. When I heard of the opportunity to work on a collaborative project between the Oberlin Opera Theater and History departments, I jumped at the opportunity to work in proximity to a preprofessional production. I was lucky enough to be given the chance to co-stage manage the opera and act as a stagehand for another opera as on-the-job training.</p>
      <p>After my experience stage managing "The Seven Deadly Sins", I realized that my sharp organizational skills and interest in theater were prefectly suited for stage management. For the last few years of my college career, I have been learning design for theater, gaining as much stage management experience as possible, and taking classes towards a theater major.</p>
